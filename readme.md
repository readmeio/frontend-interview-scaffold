ReadMeâ€™s Front End Interview
===

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! In this interview, we'll build a simple web app together. This is a great chance for you to show off your front end chops, from CSS to asynchronous state management, and everything in between! Think of it as a pairing session: we'll give you some simple product requirements and an API to hit, and ask you to build a UI out around 'em.

Since it's a relatively short session, we've provided this simple [Express server] + [React app] as a starting point.[^1] To get started, `git clone` this repo locally and `npm install`. Now run the `dev` script to [spin up the app locally][server], and you're off to the races!

We're looking forward to coding with you. ðŸ¤ž

[server]: http://localhost:4321
[Express server]: /readmeio/frontend-interview-scaffold/tree/main/server "ðŸ“‚ View the /server directory on GitHubâ†’"
[React app]: /readmeio/frontend-interview-scaffold/tree/main/client "ðŸ“‚ View the /client directory on GitHubâ†’"

[^1]: Feel free to eschew it and use your favorite framework or language instead; whatever's most comfortable for you!
